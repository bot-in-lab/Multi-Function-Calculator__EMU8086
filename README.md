# Multi-Function Calculator in Assembly Language (8086)

This repository contains the source code for a multi-functional calculator written in Assembly Language for the 8086 microprocessor. The program is designed to execute a variety of calculations and conversions through a user-friendly text-based menu system. 

## Key Features:
1. **Simple Calculator:**
   - Perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
   - Handles edge cases such as division by zero and displays appropriate error messages.

2. **Base Converter:**
   - Convert numbers between different numeral systems:
     - Decimal to Binary, Hexadecimal, and Octal.
     - Binary, Hexadecimal, and Octal to Decimal.
   - Provides step-by-step conversion logic.

3. **Temperature Converter:**
   - Convert between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
   - Handles negative and extreme temperature values gracefully.

4. **Interactive Menu System:**
   - Displays options to users in a clear format.
   - Provides prompts for invalid inputs and allows retry without restarting the program.

5. **Optimized for EMU8086 Emulator:**
   - Compatible with the EMU8086 assembler/emulator for easy testing and execution.

## Usage:
- Clone the repository and open the `.ASM` file in the EMU8086 emulator.
- Assemble and run the program to explore the features.

**Applications:**
- Ideal for students learning Assembly Language and microprocessor programming.
- Demonstrates the use of interrupts, loops, and memory operations in Assembly.
